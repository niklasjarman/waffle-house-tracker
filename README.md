# Waffle House Tracker

Welcome to the Waffle House Tracker! This repository contains both the scraper used to gather Waffle House locations and a React application to visualize and track them.

## About

The Waffle House Tracker is my solo project that scrapes Waffle House locations and allows you to visualize and track them on a map. The project consists of two main components:

- **Scraper:** The scraper collects Waffle House locations from a reliable source (mention the source) and exports the data to a JSON file.

- **React Application:** The React application uses Leaflet for mapping and allows you to interact with Waffle House locations. You can mark visited locations and filter Waffle Houses based on the selected state.

## Features

- View Waffle House locations on an interactive map.

- Filter Waffle Houses by state.
